# AI Immigrants - Copywriting

## Book Blurb

"They're taking our jobs." "They don't fit in." "They're ruining our culture."

We've heard these fears before—about immigrants. Now we're saying them about algorithms.

In *AI Immigrants*, Kevin Ryan draws an uncomfortable parallel: the same rhetoric used to scapegoat human newcomers is now being deployed against artificial intelligence. But blaming the "bloody algos" for job losses, cultural disruption, and social decay lets the real culprits off the hook—the corporate decisions, policy failures, and systemic inequalities that shape how technology is used.

Drawing on research from the World Economic Forum, IMF, and academic institutions alongside stories from warehouses, hospitals, film studios, and call centres, Ryan argues that AI is neither savior nor villain. It's a mirror reflecting our choices back at us.

This book won't tell you whether to fear AI or embrace it. It will challenge you to ask better questions: Who benefits when we blame the algorithm? What happens when we treat intelligent tools the way we've treated immigrant labour? And in a world where machines can mimic humanity, what makes us irreplaceable?

The algos are here. The question is what we do next.

AI Immigrants: "The Bloody Algos Are Here!"

A provocative exploration of AI ethics through the lens of immigration—free to download.

### Body

Every generation finds its scapegoat. In the 19th century, it was Chinese railroad workers. In 2016, it was EU migrants. Today, it's algorithms.

*AI Immigrants* examines how the fears we project onto artificial intelligence—job theft, cultural erosion, loss of control—echo centuries of anti-immigrant sentiment. The parallels aren't coincidental. They reveal something fundamental about how societies respond to change: we blame the newcomer.

But what if the algorithm is just the latest distraction from harder questions about corporate power, labour rights, and democratic accountability?

Across twelve chapters, this book dismantles the myths:

- **"They're taking our jobs"** — Automation has always displaced workers. The question is who captures the gains.
- **"They don't integrate"** — We design AI to perform humanity while denying it any stake in our society.
- **"They're ruining our culture"** — Recommendation algorithms serve what we click on. The mirror reflects us.
- **"They bring crime and disorder"** — AI bias isn't a bug. It's our prejudices, encoded and amplified.

*AI Immigrants* doesn't ask whether AI is conscious or whether robots deserve rights. It asks what our treatment of intelligent machines reveals about how we treat each other—and whether we're willing to take responsibility for the systems we've built.
